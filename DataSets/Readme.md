# Datasets 
Here you'll find a list of the datasets used by previous works, alongside links to access them, and the works that have used them. 

### Paper -> DoH Insight: Detecting DNS over HTTPS by Machine Learning
The dataset is categorized and nice but the data have been gathered in 2020 and over the implementation of DNS over HTTPS2. In the paper they mention to have 18 features chosen using Gini index. The link to the dataset is provided below:

### Papers -> Generalized Classification of DNS over HTTPS Traffic with Deep Learning && Detection of DoH Traffic Tunnels Using Deep Learning for Encrypted Traffic Classification && A novel deep-learning based approach to DNS over HTTPS network traffic detection
All of the above used this dataset, so it could be a good approach.

There's a variation of CIRA-CIC-DoHBrw-2020 dataset which is BCCC-CIRA-CIC-DoHBrw-2020 (it offers more balanced data between veridic and malicious traffic). You can find it here: https://www.yorku.ca/research/bccc/ucs-technical/cybersecurity-datasets-cds/
